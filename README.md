Interactive Programming Language Selector - This project features an interactive list of programming languages built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Clicking on a list item triggers a smooth rotation animation and displays the selected item dynamically.

<!--*  Event Delegation: 
<!--* ===================================
<!--? Event delegation is a concept in JavaScript where instead of attaching event listeners to individual elements, you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor of those elements. This is particularly useful when you have a large number of similar elements and want to reduce the number of event listeners, improve performance, and simplify code. -->

<!--* Example: List with Delegation -->
<!--? Consider a scenario where you have an unordered list (<ul>) with multiple list items (<li>), and you want to handle click events on each list item. Instead of adding a separate event listener to each list item, you can use event delegation. -->
